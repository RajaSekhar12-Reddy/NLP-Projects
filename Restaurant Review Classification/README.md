# Restaurant Review Classification

This project aims to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can automatically analyze customer reviews and predict whether they have a positive or negative sentiment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Restaurant Reviews dataset, which contains a collection of customer reviews along with their corresponding labels (positive/negative). The dataset consists of text reviews and their sentiment labels.

The dataset is available in the file `restaurant_reviews.tsv`. It contains two columns: `Review` (textual content of the review) and `Sentiment` (the sentiment label: 1 for positive, 0 for negative).
